## Data Visualization in Python using matplotlib and Plotly

# Matplotlib

# Plotly
- Plotly is particularly useful when you’re creating visualizations that will be displayed in a browser, because the visualizations will scale
automatically to fit the viewer’s screen. Visualizations that Plotly generates
are also interactive; when the user hovers over certain elements on the
screen, information about that element is highlighted.
